class Corpus:
    """
    Generic corpus that can consist of one or several files.
    Such files are typically accessed in parallel (i.e., they are assumed to have the same number of lines or entries).

    The corpus only specifies the paths and metadata associated with these files (e.g., languages, domains, corpus id),
    as well as a method for opening the files. It is up to datasets (TrainingDataset and ValidationDataset) to open the
    files, read line tuples from them and send those to `Task.preprocess` and `Task.collate`.

    The `tuple_to_dict` method converts line tuples as read from those files into a dictionary (aka "sample") that can
    be understood by the right task. These dictionary samples will be sent to `Task.preprocess`

    Each type of task will typically have its own corpus subclass (e.g., TranslationTask -> ParallelCorpus, 
    LanguageModelingTask -> MonolingualCorpus, etc.)
    It is the responsibility of the task's `get_train_corpora` and `get_valid_corpora` methods to generate lists
    of corpora based on the task's configuration.
